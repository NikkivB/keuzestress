I have decided to build an application to make choices for me. Because of my anxiety disorder I can sometimes become tired of making choices and to prevent this I wanted to make this application.
I also want to achieve with this application that I pick up the basics of PHP and html again. After all, it has been 2 years since I last worked with PHP.
### Why I decided to upload my project to GitHub
For me it is very important to have a way to track my progress. GitHub helps with this by keeping version control. 
I also want to learn how to better deal with GitHub and how GitHub works. This is so that I can immediately start working life with the right knowledge.

### What I want the application to do
I want to be able to create multiple fields from which the application can choose.
I also want to be able to store my choices as a category in a database. This is so that I can more easily make choices again or adjust a bit.

### What the application does right now (log format)

02/18/2022 > start project
  - The project currently consists of a simple page. You can fill in two choices and by means of a button you can let the application make a choice for you.
